# To-Do-List-Application-Python
The procedure of building a To-Do list management application using Tkinter is divided into several steps. These steps are shown below:

Step 1: First, we will import all the modules required to build the project.

 We will import all the required widgets and modules from the Tkinter library to provide the Graphical User Interface touch to the application. We will also import the sqlite3 module to store the data in a database.
 
Step 2: We will then define some functions necessary to execute the application.

Define various functions to operate different events in the application. These functions will allow us to add a task to the list, delete a task from the list, delete all the tasks from the list, update the list, clear the list, retrieve the database, and close the application.

Step 3: We will then create a main window for the application.

Design the main window for the application where all the widgets will be displayed. This can be done by creating an object of the Tk() class of the Tkinter library.

Step 4: We will then add a database to the application to store the data.

We will start using the connect() method to connect to the database. We will then create an object of the cursor class, which will allow us to execute SQLite statements and fetch data from the result sets of the queries. We will then use the execute() method to execute the SQL statement.

Step 5: We will add the necessary widgets to the application and apply the event triggers.

We will start by adding frames to the main window. These frames will provide a proper structure to other widgets. We will then add some labels to these frames to provide some information. We will then add an entry field so the user can enter their task. We will also add some buttons that perform specific functions like adding a task to the list, deleting one task from the list, deleting all tasks from the list, and closing the application when clicked. We will also add a list box to display all the entered tasks.

Step 6: Calling the functions in the main function of the application.

We will now call the functions to retrieve the database and update the list. We will also use the mainloop() method to run the application and establish the connection with the database.

Lastly, The Output of the TO DO LIST APPLICATION will be as given below...
